# @subfuzion/create-typescript-app

Create a Node.js app configured for TypeScript.

Configuration boilerplate includes:

* [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
* Linting and formatting
  * [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
  * [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  * [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

The linting and formatting tools have been configured to  work together:

* `.editorconfig` has format settings that feed into Prettier
* `.eslintrc.json` uses Prettier for formatting

The generated app includes a number of package scripts for development, including:
- `dev` and `dev:notify`
- `build` and `build:watch`
- `test` and `test:watch`
- `lint` and `lint:fix`

It is also configured with a `pre-commit` hook using
[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

See [typescript-starter-app
](https://github.com/subfuzion/typescript-starter-app#development)
for details.

> **Note**
>
> - If `path` isn't specified, it defaults to the current working directory (`.`).
> - The directory under `path` must be empty. 

> **WARNING**
>
> Currently under development. This implementation assumes:
> 
> 1. You're running the latest LTS version (or greater) of
>    [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (the current implementation might
>    work with earlier versions, but this hasn't been verified).
> 2. `node` and `npm` (automatically installed with Node.js) are in the path.
> 3. `git` is in your path and
>     [user.name](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer)
>     and
>     [user.email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-email-address-for-every-repository-on-your-computer)
>     are already configured.
> 4. Your system can run a `bash` script (for now).
